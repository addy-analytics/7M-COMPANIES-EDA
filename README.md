# Exploratory Data Analysis of 7+ Million Company Dataset

This is a repository for an Exploratory Data Analysis of over seven (7) million global companies Project. All analysis was done by Jessica Addy.
The datasets and Jupyter notebook used in the project is also included in this repository. This repository also contains the [Jupyter notebook]https://github.com/addy-analytics/EDA-7M-GLOBAL-COMPANIES/blob/main/7M%2B%20COMPANY-DATA.ipynb(https://github.com/addy-analytics/EDA-7M-GLOBAL-COMPANIES/blob/main/7M%2B%20COMPANY-DATA.ipynb) and datasets that were utilized in the research.

## Introduction
In 2019 the People Data Labs released 7M+ Global Company Dataset. This dataset contains information such as names, domains, sizes, years founded, industries, localities, countries and LinkedIn URLs. The raw data & official survey was downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/peopledatalabssf/free-7-million-company-dataset). 
This project's objective is to determine from the information gathered: 
1. The Annual Distribution of Companies
2. How Industries Are Distributed Among Different Nations
3. The Top 5 Industrialized Nations
4. The Top 5 Global Industries
5. Workplace Trends

In order to conduct comparable studies, I also narrowed my focus to African countries solely.

## Methodology
### Python Libraries
The libraries used on this project include:
 -  Pandas – For storing and manipulating structured data. Pandas functionality is built on NumPy
 -  Numpy – For multi-dimensional array, matrix data structures and, performing mathematical operations
 -   Seaborn - For some vizualizations
 -   Plotly Visualization Package – For all visualizations (including interactive charts)
